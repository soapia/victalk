  <p>Dear beloved readers, 
<br><br>
Much had happened since I last graced your inbox over a year ago. Chester, my lover, proved too weak an intellectual equal for me. Remind me to never date a rocket scientist again. I’ve rediscovered my love for pinot grigio and racing cars, and my passion for court-mandated community service resulting from numerous DUIs. And what a year for wholes in the market, my métier. Nothing gets me riled up like wholes in the market!! I’ll always go racing in to fill them. 
<br><br>
I write to you this week not out of my typical craving for capital or wealth, but instead out of my desire for recognizing an important moment in the life of this newsletter’s eponymous star, Victoria Hammett. Ms. Hammett turns 25 today, and I, Lauren Stronk, want to wish her the happiest of birthdays. From a cursory glance at her social media profiles, her life seems to be filled with wonderful friends, colleagues, and loved ones. 
<br><br>
If only, I, Lauren Stronk, could be so lucky.</p>
  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <section class="about-me">
    <p>I'm Lauren Stronk, author, entreprenu-her and dance instruct-him. It’s been a hard year without the warmth of my lover Chester. But let’s just say, I may be taking a break from men, but I’m certainly not taking a break from love 😉. This year, I left my dream job at FTX due to create differences I had with Sam Bankman-FRAUD, and joined an up and coming company called Theranos. But as I, Lauren Stronk, always say, never let a job get in the way of filling wholes in the market! Sayonara Suckers! MEEP MEEP!” - LS</p>

  <p>Well. Here we are. I feel incredibly stupid. I greatly overestimated the demand for a weekly newsletter dedicated to TikTok "Hacktivist" Victoria Hammett. We're three weeks in, and so far, I've received no support and made no money. And anyone who knows me, Lauren Stronk, knows I'm all about those dollar bills, baby. I anticipated racks on racks on racks, but instead, I have packs on packs on packs, of tissues, to dry my eyes from the emotional turmoil of my failed newsletter. I've never failed like this before. Chester, my lover, tries to support me, but he doesn't truly understand. He never could. No one could. </p>
  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <section class="about-me">
    <p>I'm Lauren Stronk, author and dance instructor. I've processed my emotions, and I've come to realize how invigorating failure is. I love this feeling. I can taste the adrenaline. VicTalk may be dead, but Lauren Stronk is just getting started. Next time you see a whole in the market, don't be surprised when you see me speeding in, ready to fill it before you even notice. As I always say, "Sayonara Suckers! MEEP MEEP." </p>

  <p>Here we are, and VicTalk is still chugging along! From her Instagram story and her friends only videos on TikTok, it seems like she's loving her new dog, Lola or Lulu or something, I'm not sure.In personal news, I met someone.
We're currently in the early stages of our romance where everything feels magical. I'm so happy. The only imperfection in my life is my struggling newsletter, VicTalk.</p>
